# Complex neural network in Numpy

Ongoing experiments with Artficial neural networks using Complex numbers in their architecture: weights & biases and activation functions. Here, I am researching generalization to backpropagation with Complex variables. The idea is to generalize the universal approximation principle with NN into complex valued functions which I belive are more expressive than real valued ones.
